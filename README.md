# Transtatic
Repository of my personal site [transtatic.com](http://transtatic.com).

## About
I've had the site [transtatic.com](http://transtatic.com) since around 2001 and 
it has gone through various revisions as general serves as a sandbox for what I
thinking about at the time.

## Tools & Tech 
- [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) / [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/)

### Notes
This incarnation gave me an opportunity to use some tools and technologies I 
haven't (used much) in the past such as Gulp, Foundation CSS, NPM, and ReactJS 
and also place the code/files into GitHub.

Hopefully, I'll be able to add micro-apps and update old ones and generally keep
it a bit more up-to-date.
